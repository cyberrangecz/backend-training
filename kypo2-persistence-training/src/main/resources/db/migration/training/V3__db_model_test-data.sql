  Damn computer error! <b>Network connection is slow</b>, and you are not able to sell stocks in time. Your network administrator <b>pretends that everything is fine</b> and advises you to turn your computer off and on again. Of course, that does not help and you must try to <b>fix it yourself</b>. Fortunately, you have a friend who is more familiar with information technology than you. So you call him immediately. After a while of thinking, he advises you to install the <i style="color: #008000">Wireshark</i> utility, run the packet capture, and send the result to him, just to make sure the network is working properly. Wireshark shows a lot of <b>TELNET</b> connections, but what is the biggest surprise? It contains <b>internal information</b> which should be accessible only to selected people...
</p>

<p>
  To start the packet capture, login to the Workstation (<b>username: <span style="color: #008000">bnovak</span></b>, <b>password: <span style="color: #008000">rabbit</span></b>), double-click on the Wireshark icon on the Desktop and run capture by clicking on the <b>"any"</b> network. Now you have access to <b>the content of internal reports</b> and even  <b>connection passwords!</b> Maybe it would be worthwhile to use some of the data for your profit before you report it to the administrator.
</p>

<p>
  Look at the packet capture and explore the internal reports. <b>The level flag is mentioned in the communication.</b>

Dear colleague,

our central server is much safer now! You can connect securely to the server using the "ssh" command (see a guide at https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command/). However, the upgrade brings small complications for you. I had to create new accounts for all users and set up new access passwords (see your password below). The provided password is usable only for the first login. Please change it immediately! For the sake of simplicity, I''ve created a simple tool to help you create and set up a new secure password. You can run the tool using the following command: "~/Tools/passcheck.py". IÂ believe the server and all your connections will be secure now.

SSH username: bnovak
SSH password: scorpion

If you have any problem, do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,

Dear colleagues,

when I came back from my vacation, I discovered that someone was attacking our central server and tried to access sensitive data. Based on this experience, I have decided to increase the security level of authentication. From now on, we will use authentication based on SSH keys. Please follow the guide at the following link and set your SSH keys: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2

After two weeks, I will disable password authentication. If you don''t upload your SSH key to the server, you will no longer be able to log in. Please check that your key was successfully uploaded and inserted into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

If you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
  Milos Talas

  It seems that nobody knows that you are the attacker. Lucky you! However, now you must <b>create SSH keys</b> and upload them to the server using the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2" target="_blank"><b>referenced guide</b></a>.

  You are <b>a long-term employee of Big Broker Inc.</b>, one of the biggest trading companies in the world. After so many years, you are one of the main stock traders. <b>Stock trading is your life!</b> Reliable computer and fast Internet connection are essential premises of your success. Nevertheless, a computer is just a powerful working tool for you. You don''t know much about the technology and "cyber-security" is a strange word only. <b>However, it will change very quickly...</b>
</p>

<p>
  Your path to understanding the importance of cyber-security has started when your <b>computer broke</b>, and you were not able to sell your stocks in time. Money is the most important thing for you, and now <b>you''ve lost a lot of them</b> because of the stupid error! <span style="color: #008000">It''s time to take it into your own hands and fix it!</span>

Rules
=====
<p>
  <b>WARNING: You should never use these techniques and skills to gain unauthorized access. That is illegal. The game is for educational purposes only. The main purpose is to show you that absolute security does not exist, but you can learn how to defend yourself.</b>
</p>

<p>
  Click on the <b>Topology</b> button in the blue panel on the top to see the given network topology. When you double-click on the node called Big-Broker, you should see two nodes Database (main company server) and Workstation (common office client).
</p>

<p>
  Now, to gain remote access to your workstation computer click on Workstation and select <b>Remote connection</b>. A new tab appears with remote access to the workstation computer. Use the following credentials to login â€“ <b>username: <span style="color: #008000">bnovak</span></b>, <b>password: <span style="color: #008000">rabbit</span></b>.
</p>

<p>
The game contains four levels. In each level, you will have to complete a specified task. To prove that you mastered the task, and so you are able to continue to the next level, you will have to submit a flag acquired in each task. Every level has a description of what to do and how to get the flag.
</p>

<p>
  General note: <span style="color: #008000">All programs which you will need to complete game tasks are installed (internet connection is not available). </span>
</p>


<h4 class="well well-small">Help System:</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom: 4em;">
  If you are unable to complete a level, you can use a <b>hint</b> which will give a little help, but you will lose some points. After using all the hints, there is <b>help level</b> prepared. It''s a guided solution which will tell you exactly what to do. The last option is to skip level entirely by clicking on the skip level, but this is not recommended â€“ you won''t be able to complete the next levels without performing tasks in the current one.
